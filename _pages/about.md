Hi~ I’m currently a graduate student at **<font color="#8B0012">Peking University</font>**. Before that, I graduated from the School of Computer Science and Technology at Soochow University, majoring in Computer Science and Technology & Artificial Intelligence. During my undergraduate period, I had the honor to visit Harvard University and learned the knowledge of artificial intelligence and machine learning, which benefited me a lot.

I’m now a member of the **Chinese Association of Automation** (CAA), a student member of the **China Computer Federation** (CCF), and the **Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence** (CAAI). I’m also a contributor to Zhihu, and I usually pay attention to some cutting-edge technologies and share knowledge on my web page. Besides, I am happy to make new friends, you may contact me.
