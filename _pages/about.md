Hi~ I am currently a master student at NIHDS, **<font color="#8B0012">Peking University</font>**. Before that, I received my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Technology & Artificial Intelligence from Soochow University in June 2023. I also had the honor to visit and exchange at Harvard University and learned the knowledge of artificial intelligence and machine learning, which benefited me a lot.</span><br/>

<span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;">I’m now a member of the **Chinese Association of Automation** (CAA), a student member of the **China Computer Federation** (CCF), and the **Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence** (CAAI). I’m also a contributor to Zhihu, and I usually pay attention to some cutting-edge technologies and share knowledge on my web page. Besides, I am happy to make new friends, you may contact me.</span>

- [06/2023] I will join [OpenMMLab](https://openmmlab.com/) at [Shanghai AI Lab](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) as a intern.✊
- [05/2023] One conference paper was accepted by HDSS 2023. 🎉
- [02/2023] I will join Everest Intelligence Lab at [Ximalaya Inc.](https://www.ximalaya.com/) as an algorithm intern, mainly engaged in multi-round dialogue and large language model related work. 😋
- [01/2022] I’m very happy to participate in the exchange program at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/), advised by [Dr. Peter Vaughan Henstock](https://pll.harvard.edu/instructor/peter-vaughan-henstock). Through the communication, my basic knowledge of artificial intelligence and level of English have been greatly improved. 🎉
- [12/2021] As a contributor, I participated in the [HUAWEI Ascend](https://www.hiascend.com/zh/) All-Wisdom Project, and completed the inferring work of the Cascade-RCNN-Resnet101-FPN-DCN model, which was successfully concluded. 💪
- [05/2021] I joined the [Natural Language Processing Lab of Soochow University](http://nlp.suda.edu.cn/) to conduct undergraduate research! 😋
