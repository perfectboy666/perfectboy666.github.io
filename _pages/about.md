Hi~ I’m currently a MSc student at NIHDS, **<font color="#8B0012">Peking University</font>**. Before that, I graduated from the School of Computer Science and Technology at Soochow University, majoring in Computer Science and Technology & Artificial Intelligence, advised by [Prof. Zhongqing Wang](https://wangzqsuda.github.io/index.html) and [Prof. Junhua Fang](http://ada.suda.edu.cn/_upload/tpl/02/b6/694/template694/JunhuaFang.htm). During my undergraduate period, I had the honor to visit Harvard University and learned the knowledge of artificial intelligence and machine learning advised by [Dr. Peter Vaughan Henstock](https://pll.harvard.edu/instructor/peter-vaughan-henstock), which benefited me a lot.

I’m now a member of the **Chinese Association of Automation** (CAA), a student member of the **China Computer Federation** (CCF), and the **Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence** (CAAI). I’m also a contributor to Zhihu, and I usually pay attention to some cutting-edge technologies and share knowledge on my web page. Besides, I am happy to make new friends, you may contact me.
