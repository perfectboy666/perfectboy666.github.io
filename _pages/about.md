I’m currently an undergraduate student in the **Artificial Intelligence Experimental Class** of the **School of Computer Science and Technology** at **<font color="#FF6347">Soochow University</font>**, expected to graduate in 2023. After graduation, I will study at **<font color="#8B0012">Peking University</font>**. During my undergraduate study, I had the honor to visit Harvard University and learn the knowledge of artificial intelligence and machine learning, which benefited me a lot.

I’m now a member of the **Chinese Association of Automation** (CAA), a student member of the **China Computer Federation** (CCF), and the **Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence** (CAAI). I’m also a contributor to Zhihu, and I usually pay attention to some cutting-edge technologies and share knowledge on my web page. Besides, I am happy to make new friends, you may contact me.
