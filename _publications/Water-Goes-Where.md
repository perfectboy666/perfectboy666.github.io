For a long time, water and hydroelectric power are relatively important resources. Their
rational distribution is closely related to regional agriculture, industry, residents, etc. In this
paper, we mainly study the problem of allocation scheme for Glen Canyon Dam and Hoover
Dam in the Colorado River Basin. Taking into consideration of various factors, we build
models to achieve optimal scheduling.
