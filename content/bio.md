Hi, friend!😃 I am currently a master student at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Guilan Kong](https://www.ai.pku.edu.cn/en/info/1417/1897.htm). I received my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Technology (Artificial Intelligence) in June 2023.

My research interests focus on AI for Medicine, particularly Interpretable AI for Clinical Medicine, Large Language Model (LLM)-Driven Clinical Decision Support Systems, and Electronic Health Record (EHR)-Based Multivariate Time Series Data Mining. I’m passionate about developing patient-centered, clinically applicable and explainable AI systems, and actively engage in interdisciplinary collaborations across medicine and data science. I also enjoy exploring cutting-edge technologies, and making new friends. Feel free to contact me!
