Hi~ I am currently a master student at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). I received my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Technology (Artificial Intelligence) in June 2023.

My research interests focus on AI for Medicine, particularly electronic health record (EHR)-based interpretable AI, and large language model (LLM)-driven clinical decision support. I’m passionate about developing patient-centered, clinically applicable and explainable AI systems, and actively engage in interdisciplinary collaborations across medicine and data science. I also enjoy exploring cutting-edge technologies, and making new friends — feel free to contact me!
